## Obsidian Dropbox Backups

Automated backups to Dropbox of your entire vault every 10 minutes.

Backups are stored here:

```
/Apps/Obsidian Backups/
```

Underneath that folder, backups get stored as:

```
/YEAR/MONTH/UNIX_EPOCH/VAULT
```

### Manually installing the plugin

-   Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-dropbox-backups/`.
